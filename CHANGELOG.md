Trunk Recorder ChangeLog
========================

### Version 4.4.0
* Add support for using a .csv file for adding for conventional channels
* Removed alphaTags support from config.json, use the channel.csv instead

### Version 4.3.0
* Add support for DMR / MotoTRBO


### Version 4.2.0
* Added support for tracking System Patches
* Simple Streaming Plugin
* Switch from Floats to int16 for decoder->wav
* Resets the garnder costas clock in convetional mode after each transmission

### Version 4.1.1
* Got the Wrong docker package by @MaxwellDPS in #555
* Plugin rdioscanner by @chuot in #557
* Plugin Audio Streaming CPU/Memory Usage Reduction by @JoeGilkey in #559
* Significant improvements to audioplayer by @devicenull in #549
* Read support for reading in direct CSV exports from Radio Reference by @devicenull in #547
* Fix compile errors on Fedora 35 by @chuot in #560

### Version 4.1.0
* pulls in the latest version of OP25

### Version 4.0.3
* Fixed support for P25 Conventional recorders. 

### Version 4.0
* The executable generated has changed from `recorder` to `trunk-recorder` to help prevent differentiate it from other applications that maybe instaslled.
* A new method is used to detect the end of call. Instead of waiting fora timeout after the last trunking message is recieved, the voice channel is monitored for messages announcing the end of a transmission. Each transmission is stored in a separate file and then merged together after a talkgroup stop using a frequency.
* The format for audio filenames has changed slightly. It is now: [ Talkgroup ID ]\_[ Unix Timestamp ]-[ Frequency ]-call\_[ Call Counter ].wav


### Version 3.3
* Changes the format of the config.json file. Modulation type, Squelch and audio levels are now set in each System instead of under a Source. See sample config files in the /example folder. 
* Config files are also now versioned, to help catch misconfigurations. After you have updated your config file, add "ver": 2, to the top. The processing of SmartNet talkgroup numbers as also been fixed. 
* The decimal talkgroup numbers will now match what is in Radio Reference. Please update your talkgroup.csv, if needed.

### Version 3.2
* Added support for GnuRadio 3.8

### Version 3.1.3
* Add support for uploading to Broadcastify
* Switch to using LibCurl for networking

### Version 3.1.2
* Added support for Motorola TPS Signaling
* Made Debug Recorder work over a nextwork connection

### Version 3.1.1
* Switched to use `fdkaac` & `sox` instead of `ffmpeg` to compress audio files because it is a lot easier to install
* changed to buffer sizes for blocks to a minimum to help prevent audio from getting left-over in a recorder
* prevented a recording from moving from one source to another. This likely causes audio to get jammed in a recorders buffers because a recording is stopped and things don't have a chance to flush.
* Pulled in a change request from Joe Gilkey that adds Unit Names and support for a number of analog data overlays.

### Version 3.1.0
* Updated to the latest version of OP25.
* Updated P25 Recorder, P25 Trunking and SmartNet Trunking to use the double decimation technique from OP25. It should handle SDRs with a high sample rate better now.
* Updated to the latest version of the websocketpp library.

### Version 3.0.1
* Updated to the latest version of OP25. Supposed performance improvements.

### Version 3.0
*I really have to do a better job of tracking changes... I think I got most items.*
* Bug fixes on Phase 2 decoding, catching some additional messages.
* Sending status over a WebSocket

### Version 2.2.1
* Just capturing random bug fixes

### Version 2.2
Lot's of fun things added!
* P25 Phase 2 support was added. It should just work and the P25 recorder should automatically switch between Phase 1 and Phase 2 depending on what it sees on the trunking channel.
* SmartNet BandPlan support - lets you set configs in the config.json file to specify which type of bandplan to use or define a custom one. If anyone is using VHF systems, let me know... work it probably still needed.
* Error logging - P25 recorders now keep tracking of the number of errors during decoded for each call recording. This is spit out in the Freq List in the JSON file and uploaded to openMHz.
* audioArchive - config lets you select if you don't want to save the audio recordings after they are uploaded.
* callLog - config lets you turn off JSON file creation.
* logs - I changed the formatting of the logs that are printed to the screen.
* Specify the config file from the command line using the `--config=x.json` argument.

### Version 2.1.2
* Added support for Conventional Analog and P25 systems
* Improved FSK4 performance

### Version 2.0
* Adds support for recording multiple systems and switches to using FFT for recorders.
